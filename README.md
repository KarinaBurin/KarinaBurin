My name is Karina Burin.

I'm educated on analysis of systems development and worked 1 year as a software developer with Microsoft visual language foxPro.
I started in October/2020 a new challenge which is to program the web. Buil API with .net core, and on the front I use angular v2+, with SQL server database.

I live in search of new challenges and learnings!
